# theschwartz
A simple job queue that has priorities other than speed and scalability

# Performance improvements
* fetch batches of jobs rather than one at a time
  * when #pop is called
    * and we have no items in the working batch
      * look for N jobs to work on
      * reserve them all
      * shift the first off and return it
    * and we *do* have items in the working batch
      * shift the first off and return it
      * reserve another N ?
  * so long as we can process the jobs quickly, this should be okay
    * but if we're too slow, we might have stale jobs that someone else is working on
